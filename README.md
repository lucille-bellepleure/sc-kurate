## At its core Swarm City is a blockchain based marketplace with a built in reputation system.
### Swarm City uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to allow people to communicate and transact value, and earn contextual reputation.

**The blockchain provides transparency, so users can safely interact with people they donâ€™t know, while keeping their private information to themselves. Smart contracts make sure interactions go as planned, and generate marketplace specific reputation for successful deals.**

Kurate users can:
- create visual posts
- buy and sell posts
- curate posts
- earn tokens by interacting with sponsored posts
- spend tokens by purchasing items and sponsoring causes 
- get rewarded for being a good actor by earning immutable reputation.
